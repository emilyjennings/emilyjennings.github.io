      <h2 class="project">Jaime Andrews Fitness Training</h2>
      <h2 class="project">January 2018</h2>
      <p class="project">My first freelance project was this website. Jaime Andrews needed a simple wordpress site for her health coaching clients to see what she offers. I was proud to help her start fresh and create a thriving business. She provided me with some design direction and images/content, and I used Wordpress for the first time to customize a pre-made theme. I used only HTML & CSS here because that was all she required, though I am capable of more. I learned how to make a CSS hamburger navigation menu in order to spice it up a bit. This took me about 20 hours total to complete, including contact time with GoDaddy to make a subdomain and then make the site live.</p>

      <p>"Emily doesn't just work to work, she deeply cares about helping other people and has the right personality and work ethic for it! Emily and I met while she was touring WeWork with a NYcda class and we immediately started thinking of ways our companies could partner. Since then we've worked closely to help her students improve their skills by working on real company problems and projects. I can't wait to see where this takes us! Thank you Emily!"

      <p>"Emily truly cares about building community and improving the experience of those around her. When we worked together at the New York Code and Design Academy, I saw firsthand each day how devoted she was to helping students in a number of capacities. Whether it was making sure that students were able to achieve academic goals, facilitating meaningful workshops and speaking engagements, or being an empathetic ear to struggling students, Emily made sure that everything she did was towards meeting the needs of each student. In her capacity as Community Manager she wore many hats; as the liaison between NYCDA and the students, she was highly organized and professional while also being proactive in addressing any student needs or interpersonal situations. I attended numerous networking events with Emily and witnessed how she was an advocate for the students and the organization. Her attention to detail, organization, outgoing personality, empathy, and professionalism make Emily very uniquely qualified for this position and I would recommend her for any community outreach, engagement, or related position."
