    <div id="blogtitle">I've Come a Long Way</div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock2">
      <p>It’s time to reflect on my learning journey.
      </br>
      Almost exactly a year ago, after having taken some beginner codecademy and other courses in various coding languages, I began an 8-week evening course where I joined a few other classmate and an awesome teacher to learn front end development. I knew I was completely in love from the first moment and I cherished each moment of this amazing experience into learning web development. I created this website at the end. After that, someone actually paid me to make a custom Wordpress site for them.
      </br>
      Then, I landed a job at Flatiron School and my life was forever changed. I was given the opportunity to complete the Online Software Engineering course, and here I am pretty much 50% of the way through it. I have worked on it in any moment of the day I can - I’m a mom working full time, but coding is my obsession and I push through, even when my two year old daughter is pulling my hair as I push something to GitHub. As she tests my calm and my ability to give her ample attention, I am somehow still able to read rspec tests to debug. I strive to keep valuing my abilities as a parent while still making time to learn about key/value pairs.
      </br>
      I wanted to list the three most difficult things in this learning journey in this post, but I have been sitting here for five minutes trying to come up with them. Looking back, everything is so clear, although so many struggles faced me throughout the time learning it all. This clarity is incredible proof of the power of the human mind - because just a few months ago I didn’t understand object orientation, join tables, or two to build a method. I must have learned a lot!</p>

    <div id="blogtitle">QuoteGuesser: My CLI Ruby Project</div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock2">


      <p>I finally came to the end of the Ruby section of my learning on Learn.co and I was overwhelmed when reading the description of the final project for it, thinking that I didn’t understand enough to truly set up and create an executable product. For anyone out there reading this facing similar imposter syndrome: you will be able to do this!
      </br>
      <p>I spent a day reading all the material about it and then dove right in to watching the walkthrough video by Avi. That cleared so much of it up, and I watched it again, pausing probably every minute, to set up my project structure just the way he did. I actually ran into a few roadblocks along the way there - including not being able to run my console using ./bin/console. But through some google searches I found that all I had to do was update my Ruby version. <a href ="http://codingpad.maryspad.com/2017/04/29/update-mac-os-x-to-the-current-version-of-ruby/">I found these instructions.</a>
      </br>
      <p>For <a href="https://github.com/emilyjennings/Quote_Guesser">my project</a>, I didn’t want to create a CLI program that displays movie times or something. I wanted to make a game. I used to be a teacher in South Korea, and I loved to design silly games for my students to practice English while being challenged with something out of the ordinary. I also feel very inspired by both Adam Neumann, CEO of WeWork, and by RuPaul. So, I chose to scrape a quotes website (BrainyQuotes) and then have a random quote returned that the user has to guess which of these famous people said it. They’re both such interesting and surprising people, you actually might not be able to guess right away each time! I certainly had fun playing it myself, since I don’t know all the quotes from each of them. I would imagine someone could go to the BrainyQuotes website and find the same landing page for another famous person and change which page it scrapes, tailoring it for their own uses (again, picturing it to be used in a classroom.)
      </br>
      <p>One of the concepts I struggled the most with was when to use an instance vs. a class method. I understand that the class methods are used to do something to all objects in a class, but the instance methods are used to do things to instances of the class. Some methods aren't applicable to the whole class, only to instances of it. For instance, a method that changes the elements in an array in order to be used later to change something about all the objects in the class doesn't need to be a class method. I am still wrapping my head around it, but I am confident that my understanding will grow the longer I solve these kinds of problems in Object Orientation.</p>

    <div id="blogtitle">If statements and booleans in Ruby</div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock2">
      <p>I just finished the lab called <a href="https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v4/object-oriented-ruby/object-relationships/oo-banking">"OO Banking"</a> on the Learn platform and I had to wrap my head around booleans as the only thing that can be named in conditions of an if statement in order to solve this lab. Consider this code:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          class Transfer
            attr_accessor :status, :bankaccount
            attr_reader :amount, :sender, :receiver

            def initialize(sender, receiver, amount)
              @sender = sender
              @receiver = receiver
              @status = "pending"
              @amount = amount
            end

            def valid?
              sender.valid? && receiver.valid?
            end

            def execute_transaction
              if sender.balance < amount
                @status = "rejected"
                return "Transaction rejected. Please check your account balance."
              elsif @status != "complete" && sender.valid?
                @receiver.balance = @receiver.balance + amount
                @sender.balance = @sender.balance - amount
                @status = "complete"
              end
            end

            def reverse_transfer
              if self.execute_transaction && valid? && @receiver.balance > amount && status == "complete"
                #binding.pry
                @receiver.balance = @receiver.balance - amount
                @sender.balance = @sender.balance + amount
                @status = "reversed"
              end
            end

          end
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>In order for this code to work the way it should and reverse the transfer via #reverse_transfer that was executed in #execute_transaction, the if statement must only contain booleans. That means each component of the conditionals in the if statement have to return either "true" or "false". Which part doesn't do that?</p>
      <p>It's the <code>self.execute_transaction</code> that's the problem. That's a method that doesn't return true or false. I had included it in the conditional statement because i thought the transfer had to happen before it's reversed. Turns out, that wasn't necessary, and the whole problem of the last block of my code had to do with the first part of my if statement which wasn't a boolean.</p>
      <p>Moral of today? Always ask others for help and always remember to check booleans and return values before making an if statement!</p>

    <div id="blogtitle">OO Kickstarter Lab: returning arrays</div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock2">
      <p>I took on <a href="https://github.com/emilyjennings/oo-kickstarter-flatiron-staff">this lab</a> feeling good that I'd mastered some basic concepts in OO Ruby Programming. I love the elegant way that objects can communicate with each other - it seems so satisfying and organized. For a former writer and Philosophy major, this fit my brain flow perfectly!</p>
      <p>However, I am still struggling to know when to return the array that's being added to in a method and when that's unecessary. For me, in my mind, the array is what it is and returning it isn't doing anything extra. Sometimes I think this is true. But sometimes if the method calls for something specific to be returned, the array needs to be explicitly returned.</p>
      <p>In this lab, it doesn't matter. Take the method #back_project:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        class Backer
          attr_accessor :name, :title, :project, :backers, :backed_projects

          def initialize(name)
            @name = name
            @backed_projects = []
          end

          def back_project(project)
            magic = Project.new(project)
            @backed_projects << project
            @backed_projects
            project.backers << self
            project.backers
          end


        end
      </pre>
    </code>
    <p> This does the same thing as this code:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        class Backer
          attr_accessor :name, :title, :project, :backers, :backed_projects

          def initialize(name)
            @name = name
            @backed_projects = []
          end

          def back_project(project)
            @backed_projects << project
            project.backers << self
          end

        end
      </pre>
    </code>
    <p>In this case, something just needs to be added to an array, and nothing is returned. It doesn't hurt anything to return the array!</p>

    <div id="blogtitle">Deli Counter Lab - in Ruby vs. JavaScript</div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock2">
      <p>I have just finished the Deli Counter Ruby lab in <a href="https://learn.co">Learn.co</a>, and it was interesting seeing the differences between how I solved that lab this time and over a month ago in JavaScript. First of all, I solved it so much faster this time, which means I've been grasping concepts relating to iteration and arrays! I love that I can really experience my learning progress this way. But also, I loved seeing the way Ruby handles this problem in a much simpler and more beautiful way than JavaScript. </p>
      <p>Ruby is really a beautful language because it writes so clearly and is parsimoniously. In this lab, I knew to keep a unversal variable as my first item in the code, and that's the line (or the array) that was going to be used by every method. The first time I did this lab in JS, I struggled with the concept of local and universal variables. Since learning OO Ruby, I have really grasped those concepts plus instance varibales, and I can feel the progress I've made. I also really like the Ruby iteration process, it's so much easier to write and understand than the longer and more cumbersome looping in JS. I used both kinds of iteration to solve this lab, and it's liberating to really start to feel the ways I can solve the same problem multiple ways. Furthermore, I really like how the #each method and #each_with_index method in Ruby can be used so simply to iterate over arrays in a way my mind is really set up to grasp, perhaps more naturally than I grasped loops JS because of the incrementations and conditions involved with that.</p>
      <p>I really love this platform, and that's not just because I work at <a href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>. I think it's just amazing how the integrated learning environment allows me to flow through lessons and also look back at my Github profile easily to see how I solved labs in the past. It also really builds me up in an intuitive way to solve the most complicated labs. When I solved the Tic Tac Toe Object Oriented Ruby lab, it took a long time but I did really feel like it had prepared me.</p>
