    <div id="blogtitle">Deli Counter Lab - in Ruby vs. JavaScript</div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p>I have just finished the Deli Counter Ruby lab in <a href="https://learn.co">Learn.co</a>, and it was interesting seeing the differences between how I solved that lab this time and over a month ago in JavaScript. First of all, I solved it so much faster this time, which means I've been grasping concepts relating to iteration and arrays! I love that I can really experience my learning progress this way. But also, I loved seeing the way Ruby handles this problem in a much simpler and more beautiful way than JavaScript. </p>
      <p>Ruby is really a beautful language because it writes so clearly and is parsimoniously. In this lab, I knew to keep a unversal variable as my first item in the code, and that's the line (or the array) that was going to be used by every method. The first time I did this lab in JS, I struggled with the concept of local and universal variables. Since learning OO Ruby, I have really grasped those concepts plus instance varibales, and I can feel the progress I've made. I also really like the Ruby iteration process, it's so much easier to write and understand than the longer and more cumbersome looping in JS. I used both kinds of iteration to solve this lab, and it's liberating to really start to feel the ways I can solve the same problem multiple ways. Furthermore, I really like how the #each method and #each_with_index method in Ruby can be used so simply to iterate over arrays in a way my mind is really set up to grasp, perhaps more naturally than I grasped loops JS because of the incrementations and conditions involved with that.</p>
      <p>I really love this platform, and that's not just because I work at <a href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>. I think it's just amazing how the integrated learning environment allows me to flow through lessons and also look back at my Github profile easily to see how I solved labs in the past. It also really builds me up in an intuitive way to solve the most complicated labs. When I solved the Tic Tac Toe Object Oriented Ruby lab, it took a long time but I did really feel like it had prepared me.</p>
