    <h1 class="title">Deli Counter Lab - in Ruby vs. JavaScript</h1>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p>I have just finished the Deli Counter Ruby lab in <a href="https://learn.co">Learn.co</a>, and it was interesting seeing the differences of how I solved that lab over a month ago in JavaScript. First of all, I solved it so much faster this time, which means I've been grasping concepts relating to iteration and arrays! I love that I can really experience my learning progress this way. But also, I loved seeing the way Ruby handles this problem in a much simpler and more beautiful way than JavaScript. </p>
      <p>Ruby is really a beautful language because it writes so clearly and is parsimonious. In this lab, I knew to keep a unversal variable as my first item in the code, and that's the line (or the array) that was going to be used by every method. The first time I did this lab in JS, I struggled with that. I also really like the Ruby iteration process, it's so much easier to write and understand than the longer and more cumbersome looping in JS. I really like how the .each method and .each_with_index method can be used so simply to iterate over arrays in a way my mind is really set up to grasp.</p>
      <p>I really love this platform, and that's not just because I work at <a href="https://flatisonschool.com">Flatiron School></a>. I think it's just amazing how the integrated learning environment allows me to flow through lessons and also look back at my Github profile easily to see how I solved labs in the past. It also really builds me up in an intuitive way to solve the most complicated labs. When I solved the Tic Tac Toe Object Oriented Ruby lab, it took a long time but I did really feel like it had prepared me.</p>
