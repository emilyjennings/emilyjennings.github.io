    <p>Hello world, this is a little website I've been building and practicing my tech skills while doing it. It seems blaringly obvious to me that technology pervades our lives, and I find that exhilarating! I feel the need to know how to code for practicality. I am also enjoying it immensely because it makes me feel great that I have the power to create. I really enjoy puzzles! You'll see this website evolve over time for sure.
    <p>Beyond tech, what inspires me to get up in the morning? The chance to change lives. Working in education gives me a lot of joy. What else? I just love meeting new people and I am just tickled by the idea that today might be the day when I meet someone who will change my life. I seek mentors constantly. One more thing that motivates me through every day is the idea that I have control over my thoughts and their flow, and I'm always interested in creating space and calm in my head.
    <p>For more about me, check out the <em><a href="../about/index.html">about</a></em> page.
    <p>Please explore this site to see the things I love about life. Talking about myself is boring, I'd love to find out your story! Go to <a href="../contact/index.html">contact</a> to connect with me.

    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Empathy</div></h3>
    <p class="content">I believe that empathy is the key to our success as a community. The human race cannot truly progress and overcome barriers unless we can step into each others' shoes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Authenticity</div></h3>
    <p class="content">Authenticity is so important to me throughout the realms of life. When you are honest and bring your true self to a situation, the team can work toward more holistic solutions.
    </p>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Growth</div></h3>
    <p class="content">Learning and tackling new problems expands the brain and opens up doors that weren't visible before. I am a big fan of solving seemingly insurmountable problems! I love it when people approach problems in novel ways. My goal is to be learning continuously and to keep up with the changing world.
    </p>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Diversity</div></h3>
    <p class="content">In Korea, for 5 years, I was a western face in a crowd of Korean faces. At times I craved the diversity and wildly different points of view that living in America brought me growing up in PG County, Maryland. Creating communities where different backgrounds and diverse ideas are sought and encouraged is something I support strongly.

    <h3>
      <div class="blocktitle">What I do</div>
    </h3>
    <p class="content">I am connecting people in my community to each other and helping identify the ways we can really change the world, and I am just getting started!</br></br>
      In my life I seem to often find myself helping people thrive and guiding them through journeys of various levels of transformation. This is why I love working in education, but I know that this is a part of so many other fields of interesting work. I love people and I am inspired by the strengths of humanity. I am truly alive when I am connecting to people around me in meaningful ways. I enjoy situations where my patience is put to the test and I can discover my own abilities to solve problems in the moment.
