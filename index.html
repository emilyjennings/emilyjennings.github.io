    <p>Hello world, I've been practicing my tech skills while creating this website. I started by making the basic styling with HTML and CSS, spending hours choosing the color themes I wanted which represent a Jeju beach on a cold day. Then, I learned JavaScript and jQuery and made some interactive features. I was lucky to have a great teacher. I am discovering that I love coding, and I may be slightly addicted because I really enjoy puzzles! You'll see this website evolve over time for sure.
    <p>Please explore this site to see the things I love about life. I'd love to find out your story!

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Empathy</div></h3>
    <p class="content">I believe that empathy is the key to our success as a community. The human race cannot truly progress and overcome barriers unless we can step into each others' shoes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Authenticity</div></h3>
    <p class="content">Authenticity is so important to me throughout the realms of life. When you are honest and bring your true self to a situation, the team can work toward more holistic solutions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Growth</div></h3>
    <p class="content">Learning and tackling new problems expands the brain and opens up doors that weren't visible before. I am a big fan of solving seemingly insurmountable problems! I love it when people approach problems in novel ways. My goal is to be learning continuously and to keep up with the changing world.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3><div class="blocktitle">Diversity</div></h3>
    <p class="content">In Korea, for 5 years, I was a western face in a crowd of Korean faces. At times I craved the diversity and wildly different points of view that living in America brought me. Creating communities where different backgrounds and diverse ideas are sought and encouraged is <a href="diversity/index.html">something I support strongly</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3>
      <div class="blocktitle">What I do</div>
    </h3>
    <p class="content">I am connecting people in my community to each other and helping identify the ways we can really change the world, and I am just getting started!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="floatblock">
    <h3>
      <div class="blocktitle">What I am seeking</div>
    </h3>
    <p class="content">I am hoping to solve meaningful problems together as a community and for a community. Iâ€™d love to learn skills outside my comfort zone while doing it!
