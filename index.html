    <p>Hello world, this is a little website I've been building and practicing while doing it. I love tech startups and innovation. I have been taking courses in front-end web development, UX and UI, and I have a background in philosophy, teaching, and living abroad. I lived and worked in South Korea for five years, and loved it.
    </p>
    <p>I am a people person, and my skills in empathy and communication really come into play when I am meeting people and helping them solve big problems. I do everything in my power to help women become leaders in the tech space, and to help everyone learn skills to change the world through tech. I look for deep, authentic connections and view people as whole human beings. I enjoy listening to the problems that others are facing and coming up with creative and caring solutions.
    </p>
    <p>I also enjoy creative endeavors; I sew many of my own clothes and I have written many short stories. I love meeting all kinds of new people who can give me a fresh perspective on this world. Reach out to me because I’d love to know your story!
    </p>
    <p>Please explore this site to see the things I love about life!</p>

    </h3>
    <p class="whatidocontent">I am connecting people in my community to each other and helping identify the ways we can really change the world, and I am just getting started!</br></br>
      In my life I seem to often find myself helping people thrive and guiding them through journeys of various levels of transformation. This is why I love working in education, but I know that this is a part of so many other fields of interesting work. I love people and I am inspired by the strengths of humanity. I am truly alive when I am connecting to people around me in meaningful ways. I enjoy situations where my patience is put to the test and I can discover my own abilities to solve problems in the moment.
