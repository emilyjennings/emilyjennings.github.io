    <p>Hello world, this is a little website I've been building and practicing my tech skills while doing it. It seems blaringly obvious to me that technology pervades our lives, and I find that exhilarating! I feel the need to know how to code for practicality. I also am enjoying it immensely because it makes me feel great that I have the power to create. I really enjoy puzzles! You'll see this website evolve over time for sure.
    <p>For more about me, check out the <em><a href="../about/index.html">about</a></em> page.
    <p>Please explore this site to see the things I love about life. Talking about myself is boring, I'd love to find out your story! Go to <a href="../contact/index.html">contact</a> to connect with me.

    <p class="whatidocontent">I am connecting people in my community to each other and helping identify the ways we can really change the world, and I am just getting started!</br></br>
      In my life I seem to often find myself helping people thrive and guiding them through journeys of various levels of transformation. This is why I love working in education, but I know that this is a part of so many other fields of interesting work. I love people and I am inspired by the strengths of humanity. I am truly alive when I am connecting to people around me in meaningful ways. I enjoy situations where my patience is put to the test and I can discover my own abilities to solve problems in the moment.
