            <h3>Let's start at the beginning. (This page is under construction.)</h3>
            <p></p>
        </section>
        <section id='section1'>
            <h3>I'm from College Park, Maryland.</h3>
            <p>In high school, I thought living in the suburbs of DC was devastatingly boring and I wanted to see the world. So, I left! (Spolier alert: I come back later.)</p>
        </section>
        <section id='section2'>
            <h3>Rio, Kyiv, Pretoria</h3>
            <p>Just to mention these, as a teenager I went on some exchange programs through scholarships and saving up money I earned working in retail.</p>
        <section id='section3'>
            <h3>University of Otago</h3>
            <p>After high school, I had to be far away for some reason, so I went as far as possible and studied philosophy at Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. I had so much fun that I stayed and got a Master's degree. Little did I know then, that would be a big influence on me when I got into coding.</p>
        </section>
        <section id='section4'>
            <h3>D.C. 2007-2010</h3>
            <p>I worked in various admin-type jobs in DC for a bit until I realized I wanted to do something with my career that made me feel like I was actually impacting the world. So, I became a teacher!</p>
        </section>
        <section id='section5'>
            <h3>Fayetteville, NC</h3>
            <p>After a year living in this town in N.C., the home to one of the largest military bases in the world, I was ready to take my teaching skills abroad and live another part of my life overseas for what I thought would be only a year.</p>
        </section>
        <section id='section6'>
            <h3>Jeju Island</h3>
            <p>It ended up being 5 years. I loved teaching Korean public school kids so much, I just stayed and kept renewing my contract until I was married and had a baby, and then it was time to come home.</p>
        </section>
        <section id='section7'>
            <h3>Philadelphia</h3>
            <p>It took a long time to transition to a new career trajectory after Korea. I finally landed in tech, where I felt I could make the most impact through innovation and community. I worked at a coding bootcamp. I started coding. I fell in love.</p>
            <p>Also, Philly is literally the best.</p>
        </section>
        <section id='section8'>
            <h3>D.C. Again</h3>
            <p>To be even closer to family, I finally made it back home to D.C. where I currently reside. I live in Adams Morgan where things are pretty great. I code every day. I try my best to accidentally be a hipster.</p>
