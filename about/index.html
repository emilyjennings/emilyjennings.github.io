    <h1 class="title">About Emily</h1>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p>In my life I seem to often find myself helping people thrive and guiding them through journeys of various levels of transformation. This is why I love working in education, but I know that this is a part of so many other fields of interesting work. I love people and I am inspired by the strengths of humanity. I am truly alive when I am connecting to people around me in meaningful ways. I enjoy situations where my patience is put to the test and I can discover my own abilities to solve problems in the moment.
      <p>I love tech, startups, and innovation. These are the things I surround myself with lately.
      <p>Beyond tech, what inspires me? The chance to change lives. Working in education gives me a lot of joy. What else? I just love meeting new people and I am just tickled by the idea that today might be the day when I meet someone who will change my life. I seek mentors constantly.
      <p>One more thing that motivates me through every day is the idea that I have control over my thoughts and their flow, and I'm always interested in creating space and calm in my head.
      <p>Learning is everything to me, especially when it comes to new tech skills. I have been taking courses in front-end web development, UX and UI.
      <p>Having studied philosophy extensively, I found my way into teaching in 2009. After teaching for a year in North Carolina, I lived and worked in South Korea for five years, and loved it. Before that, I lived in New Zealand for five years! I can never get enough of what human beings have to share with each other.
      <p>Empathy and communication really come into play when I am meeting people and helping them solve big problems. I love people. I look for deep, authentic connections and view people as whole human beings. I enjoy listening to the problems that others are facing and coming up with creative and caring solutions.
      <p>I have big dreams. I want to do everything in my power to help women become leaders in the tech space, and to help everyone learn skills to change the world through tech. I want to work on a team making impacts in education. I also want to become a "wizard programmer". And I want to be part of building something really impactful, as part of a wider community of disruptors and culture-builders.
      <p>I'm a single mom living in Philly, and loving it.
      <p>I love meeting all kinds of new people who can give me a fresh perspective on this world. Reach out to me because Iâ€™d love to know your story!

    <div class="questions">

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">What do you love about working in the tech industry?</p>
      <p>I love feeling like I am part of a group that's really shaping the world around it. Tech startups especially blaze trails for all kinds of other companies and industries and make impacts far beyond the reach of their immediate business dealings. I also love being around non-lazy puzzle-solvers who just like to make things work!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">What is the craziest thing you've ever done?</p>
      <p>Moving to South Korea was easy, but the craziest thing was after living there for five years I decided to leave! I had a husband and baby at the time. We sold almost all of our belongings in just a couple months. It was amazing allowing myself to let go of so many material things that I thought I "needed" and moving on!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">What is the most creative thing you've ever done?</p>
      <p>Creative endeavors are addictive for me. Beyond coding, I sew many of my own clothes and I have written short stories. The most creative and <em>successful</em> thing I've ever done was write a short story that won an honorable mention in a prestigous short story contest. It was called <em>The Hole in the Basement Closet</em> and it was a surrealistic story about two cats trapped in a house who had strange relationships with a hole in the basement closet. All metaphors!</p>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">What gets you out of bed in the morning?</p>
      <p>The opportunity to learn something new and help others do the same! I also just look forward to laughing and hearing/experiencing great stories.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">What is something most people don't know about you?</p>
      <p>I speak Korean, and although I wouldn't say I am "bilingual", I am nearly fluent in conversation.</p>
