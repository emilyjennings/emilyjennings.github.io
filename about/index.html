    <h1>About Emily</h1>


    <p>I love tech, startups, and innovation. I have been taking courses in front-end web development, UX and UI, and I have a background in philosophy, teaching, and living abroad. I am a people person, and my skills in empathy and communication really come into play when I am meeting people and helping them solve big problems. I do everything in my power to help women become leaders in the tech space, and to help everyone learn skills to change the world through tech.Â I look for deep, authentic connections and view people as whole human beings. I enjoy listening to the problems that others are facing and coming up with creative and caring solutions.

    </br></br>I am currently living in Philadelphia, PA and I love it. I love how the City of Brotherly Love comes together especially in the tech community.

    </br></br>I also enjoy creative endeavors; I sew many of my own clothes and I have written many short stories. I love meeting all kinds of new people who can give me a fresh perspective on this world. Reach out to me because I'd love to know your story!
