<!--make the keywords buttons that show parts of this following block?-->


      <p class="content">In my life I seem to often find myself helping people thrive and guiding them through journeys of various levels of transformation. This is why I love working in education, but I know that this is a part of so many other fields of interesting work. I love people and I am inspired by the strengths of humanity. I am truly alive when I am connecting to people around me in meaningful ways. I enjoy situations where my patience is put to the test and I can discover my own abilities to solve problems in the moment.
      </br></br>I love tech, startups, and innovation. These are the things I surround myself with lately.
      </br></br>Learning is everything to me, especially when it comes to new tech skills. I am a freelance web developer focusing currently on wordpress. I taught myself wordpress but I took a course in front end web development recently.
      </br></br>Having studied philosophy extensively, I found my way into teaching in 2009. After teaching for a year in North Carolina, I lived and worked in South Korea for five years, and loved it. Before that, I lived in New Zealand for five years! I can never get enough of what human beings have to share with each other.
      </br></br>I have big dreams. I want to do everything in my power to help women become leaders in the tech space, and to help everyone learn skills to change the world through tech. I want to work on a team making an impact on education. I also want to become a "wizard programmer" and be part of building something really impactful as part of a wider community of disruptors and culture-builders.
      </br></br>I'm a single mom living in Philly, and loving it.

        <div class="aboutemilyblock">
          <p class="question">What do you love about working in the tech industry?</p>
          <p>I love feeling like I am part of a group that's really shaping the world around it. Tech startups especially blaze trails for all kinds of other companies and industries and make impacts far beyond the reach of their immediate business dealings. I also love being around non-lazy puzzle-solvers who just like to make things work!</p>

      <div id="crazy">
        <div class="aboutemilyblock">
          <p class="question">What is the craziest thing you've ever done?</p>
          <p>Moving to South Korea was easy, but the craziest thing was after living there for five years I decided to leave! I had a husband and baby at the time. We sold almost all of our belongings in just a couple months. It was amazing allowing myself to let go of so many material things that I thought I "needed" and moving on!</p>

      <div id="creative">
        <div class="aboutemilyblock">
          <p class="question">What is the most creative thing you've ever done?</p>
          <p>Creative endeavors are addictive for me. I created this website from scratch and I'm learning all the possibilities of coding in wordpress. Beyond coding, I sew many of my own clothes and I have written short stories. The most creative and <em>successful</em> thing I've ever done was write a short story that won an honorable mention in a prestigous short story contest. It was called <em>The Hole in the Basement Closet</em> and it was a surrealistic story about two cats trapped in a house who had strange relationships with a hole in the basement closet. All metaphors!</p>

      <div id="bed">
        <div class="aboutemilyblock">
          <p class="question">What gets you out of bed in the morning?</p>
          <p>The opportunity to learn something new and help others do the same! I also just look forward to laughing and hearing/experiencing great stories. Also, I get motivated for chance to change lives and to have someone change mine.</p>

      <div id="world">
        <div class="aboutemilyblock">
          <p class="question">What's your favorite place you've been to in the world?</p>
          <p>Out of all the places I've been and lived, the town of Ubud, Bali is my favorite because of the incredible health foods and liberating activities there. One has no choice but to really reinvent themselves there! It's amazing being around others reinventing themselves while you're doing the same.</p>

      <div id="mom">
        <div class="aboutemilyblock">
          <p class="question">What surprised yourself most about being a mom?</p>
          <p>Before I was a mom, I thought I was a strong, independent woman. Now I know what strength really means. Everyday I become more aware of my abilities and my limits as I'm helping another human being grow. I learn the power of wonder and kindness through her experiences.</p>
