    <div class="title"><h1>About Emily</h1></div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
    <p>I love tech, startups, and innovation. These are the things I surround myself with lately.
    <p>Learning is everything to me, especially when it comes to new tech skills, and have been taking courses in front-end web development, UX and UI.
    <p>Having studied philosophy extensively, I found my way into teaching in 2009. After teaching for a year in North Carolina, I lived and worked in South Korea for five years, and loved it. Before that, I lived in New Zealand for five years! I can never get enough of what human beings have to share with each other.
    <p>Empathy and communication really come into play when I am meeting people and helping them solve big problems. I love people. I look for deep, authentic connections and view people as whole human beings. I enjoy listening to the problems that others are facing and coming up with creative and caring solutions.
    <p>I have big dreams. I want to do everything in my power to help women become leaders in the tech space, and to help everyone learn skills to change the world through tech. I also want to become a "wizard programmer".
    <p>I am currently living in Philadelphia, PA and I love it.
    <p>I love meeting all kinds of new people who can give me a fresh perspective on this world. Reach out to me because Iâ€™d love to know your story!

    <div class="title"><h1>Questions</h1></div>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">What is the craziest thing you've ever done?</p>
      <p>Moving to South Korea was easy, but the craziest thing was after living there for five years I decided to leave! I had a husband and baby at the time. We sold almost all of our belongings in just a couple months. It was amazing allowing myself to let go of so many material things that I thought I "needed" and moving on!</p>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">What is the most creative thing you've ever done?</p>
      <p>Creative endeavors are addictive for me; beyond coding, I sew many of my own clothes and I have written short stories. The most creative and <em>successful</em> thing I've ever done was write a short story that won an honorable mention in a prestigous short story contest. It was called <em>The Hole in the Basement Closet</em> and it was a surrealistic story about two cats trapped in a house who had strange relationships with a hole in the basement closet. All metaphors!</p>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
      <p class="question">Who do you admire most?</p>
      <p>She may read this, and I assume she already knows - but the person I admire most since I've moved to Philly is Felicite Moorman, CEO of StratIS and Bulogics. I want to study every decision she makes as a leader. She is an incredibly inspirational person when it comes to work culture, the tech industry, and sustainability.</p>
