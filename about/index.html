    <h1>About Emily</h1>

    <div class="aboutemilyblock">
    <p>I love tech, startups, and innovation. These are the things I surround myself with lately.
    <p>Learning is everything to me, especially when it comes to new tech skills, and have been taking courses in front-end web development, UX and UI.
    <p>I have a background in philosophy and teaching. I lived and worked in South Korea for five years, and loved it. Before that, I lived in New Zealand for five years! I can never get enough of what human beings have to share with each other.
    <p>I am a people person, and my skills in empathy and communication really come into play when I am meeting people and helping them solve big problems. I look for deep, authentic connections and view people as whole human beings. I enjoy listening to the problems that others are facing and coming up with creative and caring solutions.
    <p>I have big dreams. I want to do everything in my power to help women become leaders in the tech space, and to help everyone learn skills to change the world through tech.
    <p>I also enjoy creative endeavors; I sew many of my own clothes and I have written short stories. I love meeting all kinds of new people who can give me a fresh perspective on this world. Reach out to me because Iâ€™d love to know your story!
    <p>I am currently living in Philadelphia, PA and I love it.
